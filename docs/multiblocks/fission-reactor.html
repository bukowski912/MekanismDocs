	<h1>The Most Optimal and Compact 1435 mB/t Burn-rate Fission Reactor Setup</h1>

	<p>Author: <a href="https://github.com/UnknownSerhan">UnknownSerhan</a>.</p>
	<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> This setup only produces 16.39 MFE/t and isn't optimized for energy production.
		Making the turbine sustain all the flow rate is the primary target here, which results in less energy
		production. If you want to use fission reactor to produce even more energy, you need 3 maximum turbines to
		produce as much energy as you can.</p>

	<h1>⚠️ Things You Need to Know ⚠️</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The benefits of using sodium cooling is most visible on big setups such as this one. There are some smaller
			setups which also require sodium cooling, but they aren't as viable as this setup (they have less effect on
			max burn rate).
		</li>
		<li>This setup requires 1.239.000.000 mB grand total of sodium to work properly, otherwise you can't reach the
			maximum burn rate.
		</li>
		<li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use transmitters (pressurized tubes, mechanical pipes) to transfer
			sodium/steam/water on big setups, especially on this setup. This setup produces lots of content which has to
			be carried to other multiblocks fast enough. Using transmitters to transfer the contents will need hundreds
			of transmitters which will result in low fps! Because of this, this setup uses "Port to Port" method to
			transfer its contents (see the next comment below to learn more).
		</li>
		<li>"Port to Port" lets you transfer contents between multiblocks with an "infinite" transfer rate. Ports of
			multiblocks are touching each other to transfer their contents with no transmitters at all, because
			transmitters are a huge bottleneck when there isn't enough of them. Port to port is very useful on big
			setups such as this.
		</li>
		<li>You <strong>MUST</strong> keep all the chunks of the setup loaded for it to work, otherwise the reactor
			might explode.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>🛠️ How to Build 🛠️</h1>

	<h2>Fission Reactor</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Build a 18x18x18 frame and fill the faces with either casings or reactor glass.</li>
		<li>Place the fissile fuel assembly columns and control rod assemblies by considering "Checkerboard Pattern"
			(columns shouldn't touch each other, they will touch only diagonally). You can place up to 1920 fissile fuel
			assemblies if you want to, but it won't let you achieve higher burn rates, it is just for aesthetics and
			more
			fuel/waste storage in reactor.
		</li>
		<li>Add the ports for the reactor (see the images below).</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Boiler</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Build a 18x18x18 frame with boiler casings and fill the faces with either casings or reactor/structural
			glass.
		</li>
		<li>Place the pressure dispersers 4 block below the top layer (so there are 3 empty layers above pressure
			dispersers).
		</li>
		<li>Place 90 superheating elements anywhere below pressure dispersers.</li>
		<li>Add the valves for the boiler (see the images below).</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Turbine</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Build a 17x16x17 frame (you can make it 2 blocks higher if you want to store more energy in the turbine or
			just care about aesthetics) with turbine casings and fill the bottom with either structural glass or turbine
			casings.
		</li>
		<li>Find the center block of the bottom layer and place 2 rotors.</li>
		<li>Add 1-4 blades, depending on if you want to use the energy or just dump it. See how to dump the energy in
			<b>"Images"</b> section.
		</li>
		<li>Place the rotational complex above the rotors.</li>
		<li>Place pressure dispersers on the same layer as the rotational complex.</li>
		<li>Place an electromagnetic coil on top of the rotational complex.</li>
		<li>Place 450 saturating condensers anywhere inside the turbine.</li>
		<li>Add vents on the roof of the turbine and everywhere above the steam tank of the turbine. You will need at
			least 900 vents in total.
		</li>
		<li>Add the valves for the turbine (see the images below).</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>📌 Circuit Breakers 📌</h1>

	<h2>Circuit Breaker</h2>

	<p>If you want your reactor to shut itself down when there is a problem, you can build a circuit breaker.</p>

	<figure>
		<img src="../media/Serhan/circuit-breaker.png" alt="" class="grow"/>
		<figcaption>The most basic circuit breaker.</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>On this circuit breaker, the bottom redstone logic adapter is set to "High Temperature" mode.
		Once the reactor has reached critical temperatures, this redstone logic adapter will send a redstone signal and
		activate the piston, which will activate the top redstone logic adapter. The top redstone logic adapter is set
		to "Activation" mode. This logic adapter will turn off the reactor when redstone signal is provided for it.
		There is also a pressurized tube that has redstone sensitivity enabled. Once the bottom redstone logic adapter
		emits a redstone signal, the torch will go off and it will enable the pressurized tube. The pressurized tubes
		have sodium in them, which will rush into the reactor to cool it down. It is important to have a significant
		amount of sodium ready to rush in the reactor, small amounts of sodium won't be able to cool the reactor down.
	</p>

	<h2>My Own Circuit Breaker Design</h2>

	<p>There is a simpler circuit breaker design that works instantly and is precise:</p>

		<div>
			<video controls>
				<source src="../media/Serhan/simple-circuit-breaker.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>This circuit breaker uses a laser tractor beam to break the reactor in an emergency to stop it completely. This
		breaker is useful especially when your reactor explodes due to server-sided chunk loading issues.</p>

	<h1>❓ Frequently Asked Questions ❓</h1>

	<hr/>
	<p><strong>Q:</strong> With the new 10.3.6 update for 1.19.2, I can add decimals to reactor burn rate number. Should
		I add decimals to 1435 to get more burn rate?
	</p>
	<p><strong>A:</strong> It depends. Since the biome temperature is being taken into account while the reactor runs,
		the maximum decimal you can go between 1435 and 1436 depends on the biome temperature. You can go higher
		decimals on colder biomes but warning: this is not safe at all and might damage the reactor! If you want to be
		completely safe, just keep it at 1435.
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<p><strong>Q:</strong> I am using Quantum Entangloporters to transfer the contents of the multiblocks. Is it a good
		idea?</p>
	<p><strong>A:</strong> Quantum Entangloporter have an internal buffer which is very low for this setup. You would
		need hundreds of Quantum Entangloporter to get the job done (just like transmitters), so it is not recommended
		at all.</p>
	<hr/>
	<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you calculate how many vents and how many saturating condensers you need?</p>
	<p><strong>A:</strong> First, you need to figure out the flow rate of steam coming to the turbine. For example, 1435
		burn rate reactor generates 287.000.000 mB of superheated sodium which generates about 28.700.000 mB of steam
		(it is 10:1 ratio between sodium and steam). Each vent adds 32.000 mB of flow rate to the turbine. By dividing
		the flow rate of steam to 32.000, you can find out how many vents you need. To calculate how many saturating
		condensers you need, just divide the vent count you found to 2. This will give you the number of saturating
		condensers you need.</p>
	<hr/>
	<p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I figure out how many Solar Neutron Activators do I need?</p>
	<p><strong>A:</strong> This depends on the biome and the height you place the Solar Neutron Activators (SNA) in.
		Colder biomes and higher places are better for Solar Neutron Activators and they will work faster. To find out
		how many of them you need for this setup, divide 143.5 to the number "a Solar Neutron Activator's max production
		at noon" to get the number needed.</p>
	<hr/>
	<p><strong>Q:</strong> I have infinite water sources, do I really need to cycle water from the turbine/do I really
		need a turbine?</p>
	<p><strong>A:</strong> If you have some sort of transfer method that doesn't have a limit to transfer the water from
		the infinite water source to the boiler, then you don't have to cycle water from your turbine. You can't avoid
		building a turbine because if you do, the steam will stay in the boiler and if the steam tank gets full, the
		boiler will stop working!</p>
